API Overview
Warning: Version 2 is in beta testing mode; changes may be made to this API version at any time without prior notice.

Our API allows you to obtain all of ScreenScraper's data and media to integrate into your applications: front-ends, utilities. All our requests return the desired information in XML, JSON, or INI format.

Who can use the API?
The ScreenScraper API can only be integrated into completely free and distributed applications, or, otherwise, with prior authorization and under the conditions dictated by the ScreenScraper team. Any violation of this rule may result in account suspension or even legal action!
If you are a developer and want to integrate our API, contact us via the forum to present your software and obtain your username and password to provide to the API to validate your usage rights.

How do I make requests to our API?
Requests for information and/or media to the ScreenScraper API are made by calling GET URL requests, and an XML or JSON document is returned. Example: Search Game: https://api.screenscraper.fr/api2/jeuInfos.php?devid=xxx&devpassword=yyy&softname=zzz&ssid=test&sspassword=test&output=xml&crc=50ABC90A&systemeid=1&romtype=rom&romnom=Sonic%20The%20Hedgehog%202%20(World).zip&romtaille=749652
=====
How many simultaneous API requests are allowed?
Depending on the user's contribution level (to the database or financially), they are allocated "Threads."

What is a "Thread"?
Some scraping software, like "Universal XML Scraper," allows you to save scraping time by processing ROMs simultaneously, rather than one by one.
The number of simultaneous scrapes is what we call a "Thread."
So, with 4 Threads, you scrape your ROMs 4 at a time, which represents a huge time saving.
However, this puts much more strain on your computer and bandwidth (so it needs sufficient resources), but above all, it puts much more strain on the database and the server hosting it.
That's why the "reward" system was implemented. To thank you for contributing to the Screenscraper database, we offer you the opportunity to access its resources more efficiently.


How do you earn "Threads"?
There are two simple methods:
- Contribute to the database by suggesting new information or media
- Contribute financially to the database hosting via Tipee or Patreon.


How many "Threads" can I earn?
Consult the FAQ for more information.
=====
How many API requests are allowed per minute and per day?
Since approximately mid-2019, a quota system has been integrated into the API to prevent server overload.

The principle is to limit API access for each user per minute and per day based on their level and financial contribution.

Consult the FAQ for more information.

Quota information is included in the user data so that it can be easily integrated and managed directly by the scraping software.
This software-based quota management is now mandatory to avoid unnecessarily overloading our servers.
